# Blood Supply Intelligence Platform

## Overview

The Real-Time Blood Supply Intelligence Platform is an end-to-end streaming data engineering project that simulates blood inventory and demand events, processes them through a Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold), and delivers operational insights through Power BI dashboards.

The platform leverages Apache Kafka for event streaming, PySpark Structured Streaming for real-time processing, Delta Lake for reliable storage, Docker for containerization, and Power BI for analytics visualization.

## Project Objectives

* Simulate real-time blood inventory events.
* Process streaming data using Apache Spark.
* Implement Medallion Architecture using Delta Lake.
* Generate operational metrics for blood inventory management.
* Visualize insights using Power BI dashboards.

---

## Dataset

The simulated dataset contains blood inventory events with attributes such as:

* Event ID
* Timestamp
* Blood Type
* City
* Current Inventory
* Units Used
* Inventory Status
* Hospital Information

The generator continuously produces events to emulate real-world blood bank operations.

---

## Data Pipeline

### Bronze Layer

Purpose:
Store raw streaming events received from Kafka.

Operations:

* Kafka ingestion
* JSON parsing
* Schema enforcement
* Raw Delta Lake storage

Output:

```text
/data/bronze
```

---

### Silver Layer

Purpose:
Create validated and cleaned datasets.

Operations:

* Data quality checks
* Null handling
* Type validation
* Inventory status classification

Output:

```text
/data/silver
```

---

### Gold Layer

Purpose:
Generate business-ready aggregated metrics.

Aggregations:

* Average Inventory
* Total Units Used
* Event Counts
* Inventory Status Distribution
* Blood Type Analytics

Output:

```text
/data/gold
```

Example Gold Schema:

| Column           | Description              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| blood_type       | Blood group              |
| city             | City                     |
| inventory_status | HEALTHY / LOW / CRITICAL |
| avg_inventory    | Average inventory level  |
| total_units_used | Total units consumed     |
| event_count      | Number of events         |

---

## Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard provides real-time operational visibility through:

### KPI Cards

* Total Units Used
* Total Events
* Average Inventory

### Visualizations

* Blood Usage by Blood Type
* Inventory Status Distribution
* Average Inventory by Blood Type
* Blood Inventory Monitoring Table
